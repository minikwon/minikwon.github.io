  <h3>Don't do what's good for you. Do what's BEST for you.</h3>
	<p>Hello! My name is Saeam Kwon and I am currently a senior at University of California at Berkeley studying Cognitive Science. I am persuing the medical field to hopefully aid those less fortunate. Other than random medical facts, I also have great interest in video games, food, music, and programming! Right now I am constructing this website from scratch while learning HTML and CSS as I go. Please enjoy your stay and feel free to explore my website!</p>
